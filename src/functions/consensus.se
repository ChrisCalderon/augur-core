#1. Record rep at start of report period [before rep in make reports]
#2. Penalize for each event
#3. Each reporter needs to do this for all events they reported on, if not get docked
#4. For first half of the new period, people can do penalization for the last period, for the second half users have to claim rep then trading fees
#5. If you don't do it for all events or don't penalize for not reporting enough, autolose 20% rep each period one does this (b/c they're trying to cheat)
# Errors:
    # -1: pushed forward event already resolved, so can't redistribute rep based off of its original expected expiration period
    # -2: already past first half of new period and needed to penalize before then
    # -3: need to do not enough reports penalization [or lackthereof]
# roundTwoResolve needs to be called for any event here before can be penalized if it's a backstop 1 event, a la close market for other events before being penalized
# always use uncaught + caught version as opposed to actual outcome for this to be safe wrt ethicality / diff. for payouts
